By using our services and products you are agreeing to discharge us of any and all claims, injuries, damage or loss to yourself and/or property, including those originating from or connected to your participation in our services or products. This includes any claims or liabilities that are caused or contributed to by negligence on our behalf. Any guarantees, representations and policies not explicitly mentioned in these terms and conditions are excluded to the scope that is permitted under any applicable law.</p>
       <h4 class="p-2">Products:</h4>
       <p class="p-2">Our products are provided in English only. We are not in any way responsible for any claims or liabilities resulting from one of our products being translated as information may be lost in translation. Our programs vary in cost and their target market determination (beginner, low-intermediate, intermediate, highly experienced) is clearly stated in each respective programs description. After a successful purchase (facilitated by “Simple Goods” payment gateway) of any of our programs you will receive a link (delivered via email, to the email inputted during the purchase process) where you will be able to download your program in PDF format, requiring at minimum 1 MB of space and a suitable PDF viewing software such as the free google docs.

Any issues with the link or its expiry before you can successfully retrieve your product please contact growththroughmotion@gmail.com so we can resolve the issue.</p>
       <h4 class="p-2">Ongoing Services:</h4>
       <p class="p-2">Product updates may occur whereby our programs are altered in order to improve them. Any product owners will receive this updated product using the same method of delivery as their initial product purchase. The updates are not obligatory to utilise, as you will still keep your original program copy. Some of our programs offer ongoing support throughout the program's term in the form of weekly check ins. Said weekly check-ins are strictly not to be used by yourself to make any modifications to the programs we provide, nor to make any medical decisions upon. The weekly check-ins are provided for purpose of customer support and possible adjustments, dependent on individualistic circumstances to the remaining portion of the program, to be conducted by us only. The ongoing support is organised via email within 48 hours of product purchase, where a timeline for the program conduction, by yourself will be communicated. This is done so that the weekly check ins can be conducted at a point in time that is suitable for yourself. The weekly check-ins can be organised for commencement at a later date via the aforementioned communication; this has a maximum delay from the initial purchase date of 30 days. A request can be made, if personal issues arise, such as illness or extenuating circumstances, whereby we reserve the right to ask for evidence, or if lack thereof, deny any requests, for a further delay of weekly check-in commencement, where the maximum delay may be extended by an additional maximum of 90 days.</p>
